# MLB Digital Engagement Model

The baseline model uses lightGBM and the second model uses a set of fully-connected layers + LSTM (from Pytorch). I am still in progress with the second model.
The data comes from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/mlb-player-digital-engagement-forecasting/data).
